# University work

Primarily consists of files relating to my masters thesis where I explore a variety of different analytical approaches to sports betting, 
varying from primitive strategies such as "bet on the strong favourite" to using advanced predictive data generated 
by sports consultancies.

I have also included some work I did on using K-means clustering to classify football teams, using their SPI ratings (from fivethiryeight.com)
